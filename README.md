Welcome to UgaMaska, the finest mask workshop in the Uga tribe. The great Uga Ritual is imminent, and the line of villagers is growing. As the Master Craftsman, it is your duty to swiftly interpret the desires of your tribe. You have only seconds to understand the personality of each customer, from restless children to demanding elders, and create the perfect mask for them.

Time is running out and the tribe is waiting. Can you keep your cool and work with precision to ensure that everyone arrives at the Uga Ritual with their mask?
